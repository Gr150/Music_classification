As part of my coursework at coventry, this project implements a music classification system using various machine learning algorithms.

The system is capable of classifying music into different genres based on audio features extracted from the tracks. 

# Installation

Clone the repository if you want to run it. 

# Algorithms used:

The following classifiers have been implemented and evaluated:

 Decision Tree Classifier: 
A simple and interpretable model that uses a tree structure to make decisions.

 Random Forest Classifier:
An ensemble method that improves the performance of decision trees by using multiple trees.

 K-Neighbors Classifier: 
A non-parametric method that classifies based on the majority vote of nearest neighbors.

 Support Vector Machine (SVM):
A powerful model that finds the optimal hyperplane for classification in high-dimensional space.
